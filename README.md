# Predict_Deliverytimes_onlinefoodorders_Rgressionanalysis
This project demonstrates the application of  multiple linear regression to predict delivery times for online food orders. Using a dataset of various features related to food orders, we build a model to estimate the delivery time with high precision.
Linear Regression: A statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (delivery time) and one or more independent variables (features of the food order).
Feature Engineering: The process of selecting and transforming variables to improve the predictive power of the model.
Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the model using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
